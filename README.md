# About this repository

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that can be used with Google Colab or the Binder service (virtual Docker). The notebook will pull data from a Dataverse dataset, describe the reason for the notebook and the uses of a Jupyter notebook when curating data in a Dataverse. Use one of the links below to start testing the notebook.

Launch the notebook in Google Colab (fastest option)

Launch the notebook in Binder (a much slower service in my opinion)
